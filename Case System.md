## I. Overview

**Case** is a unified dependency-marking system that encodes the **geometric topology** of vr̥tti-fields (see [[Vr̥tti Ontology]]). It is not an arbitrary collection of morphological features but a mathematical description of how entities (nouns and vr̥ttis) orient themselves relative to the central pulse of meaning.

In most other languages, "case" refers exclusively to nominal inflection. This grammar generalizes the concept: case marks **any** dependency relation, whether the dependent is a noun or a verb.

This grammar recognizes two case domains:
- [[Noun Cases]] mark how nouns depend on vr̥tti-heads or other nouns.
- [[Verb Cases]] mark how subsidiary vr̥ttis depend on head-nouns.

Both operate within the same geometric framework: case as **relational topology**, not purely semantic content.

## II. Case as Vr̥tti Geometry

### 1. Geometric Principle

The finite vr̥tti (verb) establishes a **semantic field** with inherent geometric structure:
- **Poles** (C1, C2): the structural skeleton—primary and secondary anchor points
- **Vectors** (ABL, DAT): directional flow—source and goal of the pulse
- **Substrate** (SUB): the ambient medium through which the pulse propagates

Case morphology **measures position** within this field. It is coordinate geometry applied to meaning-space.

### 2. Field Curvature

Just as mass curves spacetime in general relativity, the vr̥tti **curves semantic space** around itself. Case marks the trajectory of entities through this curved space:

- Nouns near the **poles** (C1/C2) experience maximal coupling—they are the vr̥tti's core participants
- Nouns at the **source** (ABL) mark where the impulse originates
- Nouns at the **goal** (DAT) mark where the impulse resolves
- Nouns in the **substrate** (SUB) mark the background field

_Case is not "meaning"—it is **geometric necessity**. The morphology simply makes field structure explicit._

### 3. No Arbitrary Assignment

Traditional grammars treat case as arbitrary marking (nominative = "subject," accusative = "object"). This grammar treats case as **structural description**:

- C1 is not "nominative"—it is *the primary pole where meaning crystallizes*
- C2 is not "accusative"—it is *the secondary pole expressing dyadic polarity*
- ABL is not "instrumental/ablative"—it is *the source-vector of the pulse*

## III. The Five-Dimensional Field

The primary nominal cases (C1, C2, ABL, DAT, SUB) form a **coordinate system** in semantic space:

| Axis      | Dimension        | Geometric Role                    | Type        |
| --------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **C1**    | Primary pole     | Structural anchor (point)         | Structural  |
| **C2**    | Secondary pole   | Dyadic complement (point)         | Structural  |
| **ABL**   | Source vector    | Origin of impulse (direction)     | Directional |
| **DAT**   | Goal vector      | Resolution of impulse (direction) | Directional |
| **SUB**   | Substrate field  | Ambient medium (volume)           | Substrate   |

These are not arbitrary labels—they are **basis vectors** for measuring position in the vr̥tti-field.

**Additional nominal cases** (GEN, VOC, GEN⁻¹) lie outside this five-dimensional core system and serve specialized relational or pragmatic functions.

## IV. Nominal vs. Verbal Cases

### Nominal Cases

Measure how **nouns** relate to vr̥tti-heads or to other nouns:
- **Primary function:** encode dependency geometry of nominal arguments
- **Marked on:** nouns and noun phrases
- **Core inventory:** C1, C2, ABL, DAT, SUB (+ GEN, VOC, GEN⁻¹)

See [[Noun Cases]] for full morphological specifications.

### Verbal Cases

Measure how **subsidiary vr̥ttis** (participial forms) relate to head-nouns:
- **Primary function:** encode how dependent vr̥ttis modulate head-nouns
- **Marked on:** non-finite verb forms (participles)
- **Core inventory:** C1⁻¹, C2⁻¹, ABL⁻¹, DAT⁻¹, SUB⁻¹, PROP

**Two mechanisms:**
1. **Inverse cases (K⁻¹):** projection operators that externalize one internal role
2. **Propositive (PROP):** norm operator that links the entire vr̥tti-field

See [[Verb Cases]] for operator definitions; [[Clause Structure]] for clause formation patterns.

---

## V. Case as Field Operators

### 1. Nominal Cases: Position Markers

Nominal cases specify **where** a noun sits in the vr̥tti-field:
- **C1/C2:** structural coupling to poles
- **ABL/DAT:** alignment with directional vectors
- **SUB:** immersion in the ambient substrate

_Like cartesian coordinates specifying location in cartesian space, nominal cases specify location in semantic space._

### 2. Inverse Verbal Cases: Projection Operators

Inverse cases **project** a specific role out of the vr̥tti-field:

_In linear algebra, a projection operator extracts one component of a vector. K⁻¹ projects one role out of the vr̥tti's multi-dimensional field—the head-noun *is* that participant._

See [[Verb Cases]] for the full inventory; [[Clause Structure]] for relative clause formation.

### 3. PROP: Norm Operator

PROP collapses the **entire vr̥tti-field** into a scalar-like entity linked to a head-noun:

_If inverse cases are vector projections, PROP computes the norm—the head-noun *contains* the event-as-totality, then occupies a coordinate in the matrix field via its nominal case._

See [[Verb Cases]] for the geometric definition; [[Clause Structure]] for complement and adverbial clause formation.

## VI. Valency and Dependency

### 1. Valency Preservation

**Metaphysical necessity:** Fields cannot have gaps. Every role present in the vr̥tti's semantic spectrum must manifest syntactically.
- Externalization (via K⁻¹) **relocates** but never deletes
- PROP **embeds** the entire field intact
- The grammar is **informationally lossless**

### 2. Verb Valency

Each verb-vr̥tti specifies its field structure:
- **Monadic:** one core participant → mapped to **C1**
- **Dyadic:** two core participants → mapped to **C1** and **C2**

Additional participants appear in **ABL**, **DAT**, or **SUB**, unless the verb lexically requires a semantic case as a core argument.

### 3. Case and Dependency

Case is the **morphological signature** of dependency:
- Nominal cases = nouns depending on vr̥ttis or other nouns
- Verbal cases = vr̥ttis depending on nouns

Both measure **coupling strength** and **geometric orientation** within the semantic field.

## VII. Philosophical Foundation

This case system encodes the metaphysics of **Directed Unity** (see [[Vr̥tti Ontology]]):
- The vr̥tti is a **single pulse** whose meaning unfolds
- **C1/C2** express its **structural skeleton**
- **ABL/DAT** express its **poles of emergence and resolution**
- **SUB** expresses its **ambient substrate**
- **K⁻¹** and **PROP** modulate how subsidiary pulses couple to the primary field

Case is not arbitrary morphology—it is the **visible trace** of semantic field geometry. To decline a noun or a verb is to specify coordinates in meaning-space.
