## I. Overview

Nominal cases mark how **nouns** depend on vr̥tti-heads or other nouns. This document specifies the morphological inventory and usage patterns. For the geometric and philosophical foundations of the case system, see [[Case System]].

The language has **two structural** and **three semantic** core cases that exhaust all noun–verb dependency relations in finite clauses. Additionally, three specialized cases (GEN, VOC, GEN⁻¹) handle noun–noun relations, pragmatic address, and possessor extraction.

## II. Core Structural Cases

### 1. Primary (C1)
- The **syntactic anchor** of each finite clause
- Exactly one per clause (if any nouns appear)
- Encodes no semantic role inherently—the verb's class determines which participant maps to C1

**Geometric essence:** *The primary pole—the point of maximal structural coupling to the vr̥tti*

### 2. Secondary (C2)
- The **second core argument** of dyadic vr̥ttis
- Appears only when the verb specifies two core participants
- Also role-neutral

**Geometric essence:** *The secondary pole—complementary position expressing dyadic polarity*

---

## III. Directional Semantic Cases

### 3. Ablative (ABL)
Marks entities functioning as **points of origin** for the vr̥tti:
- source of motion or transfer ("from X")
- causal origin or motivation ("because of X")
- instrument or enabling means ("with/by X")
- material cause ("made from X")

**Geometric essence:** *The source-vector—where the impulse of the vr̥tti originates*

### 4. Dative (DAT)
Marks entities functioning as **endpoints of orientation**:
- destination or direction ("to/toward X")
- recipient or beneficiary ("for X")
- perceptual or attentional target ("at X")
- emotional or intentional endpoint

**Geometric essence:** *The goal-vector—where the vr̥tti is directed or resolved*

### 5. Substrative (SUB)
Marks the **ambient field** in which the vr̥tti unfolds:
- spatial/temporal locus ("in/on/at/during X")
- states and manners ("in silence", "as a king", "in anger")
- comitative/co-participant ("with X")
- environmental or perceptual medium ("through X", "under X")
- domain, topic, circumstance

**Geometric essence:** *The substrate or medium holding the vr̥tti*

## IV. Verb Valency and Case Assignment

Each verb-vr̥tti specifies its argument structure:
- **Monadic:** one core participant → mapped to **C1**
- **Dyadic:** two core participants → mapped to **C1** and **C2**

Additional participants appear in **ABL**, **DAT**, or **SUB**, unless the verb lexically requires a semantic case as a core argument.

**Example patterns:**
- Motion verbs: typically require ABL (source) and/or DAT (goal) adjuncts
- Instrument verbs: may lexically require ABL as core argument
- Locational verbs: may lexically require SUB as core argument

## V. Specialized Cases

### 6. Genitive (GEN)

The **Genitive** lies outside the five primary cases. It marks **noun–noun dependency**, not noun–vr̥tti dependency:
- possession ("X's Y")
- part–whole relations ("the city's gate")
- inherent association ("the king's authority")
- substance or content relations ("a cup of water")

**Essence:** *Attributive relation between nouns—one noun delimits or specifies another*

**Syntax:** The genitive-marked noun precedes and modifies the head noun.

### 7. Vocative (VOC)

The **Vocative** is purely **pragmatic**, used for direct address. It is independent of syntactic or semantic dependency:
- summons, calls, invocations
- interpersonal or ritual address

**Essence:** *Direct channel of attention from speaker to addressee; establishes presence, not relation*

**Syntax:** Typically appears at clause periphery (initial or final); prosodically marked.

### 8. Genitive Inverse (GEN⁻¹)

The **Genitive inverse** is the sole nominal inverse marker and does not interact with verbal dependency. It promotes an inherent possessor or attributive nominal to head position while keeping the possessed noun internal:

- **GEN** = attributive noun–noun link within the noun phrase
- **GEN⁻¹** = externalizes that attributive participant as the head-noun

**Example structure:**
```
Normal: [king(GEN)] crown
        "the king's crown"

Inverse: [crown] king(GEN⁻¹)
         "the king, whose crown [...]" (crown becomes the head)
```

**Essence:** *Promotion device internal to nominal morphology*

## VI. Case Stacking and Compounding

### 1. No Case Stacking

Each noun bears **exactly one case marker**. The language does not permit case stacking (e.g., *noun-GEN-DAT).

### 2. Compound Case Phrases

Complex spatial/temporal/manner expressions may be expressed through:
- Nominal compounding + single case
- Adpositional constructions
- Dependent clauses with abstract head-nouns
