## I. Overview

This grammar is grounded in a **vr̥tti ontology**: a non-dual ([advaita](https://www.advaita-vedanta.in/understanding-advaita#h.w8uwzt3gam3q)) metaphysics where all semantic distinctions arise as perturbations within an undifferentiated continuum. Language does not represent pre-existing objects and relations; it **enacts** the collapse of semantic potential into determinate form.

The finite verb is the **ontological pulse**—the primary locus where meaning crystallizes. All other elements (nouns, cases, modifiers) derive their identity through dependency on this pulse. Morphology does not add features but **filters** and **specifies** latent semantic structure.

This ontology is not metaphor—it is the **generative principle** from which all grammatical structure follows.

## II. The Non-Dual Ground (Śabda-Brahman)

### 1. Undifferentiated Semantic Continuum

At the foundation lies **[śabda-brahman](https://hal.science/hal-03372632/document)**—the unmanifest semantic plenum from Vedic philosophy. This is not absence but *superposition*: all possible meanings coexist in potential, undifferentiated and unactualized.

Language does not reference this ground; it **emerges from it** through vr̥ttis—ripples or modulations that introduce distinction without severing unity.

*There are no meanings, only meaning-space. All semantic content is continuous until a vr̥tti carves apparent boundaries.*

### 2. Vr̥tti as Ontological Perturbation

A **vr̥tti** (वृत्ति, "turning, modulation") is:
- A **wave** in semantic space
- A **filter** that resolves superposition into specificity
- A **pulse** that radiates identity to its dependents

The term draws from [Yogic philosophy](https://senhri-journal.pucollege.edu.in/storage/articles/the-concept-of-yoga-and-its-goal-zZ9U.pdf) (*citta-vr̥tti*—modulations of consciousness) but functions here as the fundamental unit of linguistic ontology. Each vr̥tti is simultaneously event, field, and collapse—the actualization of one semantic trajectory from infinite potential.

### 3. The Gradient of Manifestation

Meaning unfolds in three phases, recapitulating the cosmological rhythm of creation:

**Unmanifest (avyakta)** → **Manifest (vyakta)** → **Reabsorbed (laya)**
- **Unmanifest:** The semantic field as pure potential (lexical root)
- **Manifest:** Actualization through morphological specification (derived forms)
- **Reabsorbed:** Integration into larger vr̥tti-fields (finite clauses)

Language enacts this cycle: roots hold infinity; derivation collapses it; syntax integrates it.

## III. Bhartr̥hari's Sphoṭa and Vr̥tti

### 1. Sphoṭa as Semantic Burst

In [Bhartr̥hari's philosophy of language](https://www.anantaajournal.com/archives/2024/vol10issue2/PartB/10-2-25-535.pdf), **sphoṭa** (स्फोट, "burst") is the indivisible meaning-bearing unit that "flashes forth" in consciousness upon hearing speech. It exists at three nested levels:
- **Varṇa-sphoṭa**: phoneme-level unity
- **Pada-sphoṭa**: word-level unity  
- **Vākya-sphoṭa**: sentence-level unity

The sphoṭa is not constructed from parts—it is a **holistic cognitive event**. Phonemes and morphemes are merely **triggers** that cause the sphoṭa to manifest, not building blocks that compose it.

### 2. Vr̥tti as Sphoṭa-Modulation

**Vr̥tti** is the dynamic counterpart to sphoṭa:
- **Sphoṭa** = the timeless semantic potential (the field in superposition)
- **Vr̥tti** = the act of modulation that collapses sphoṭa into a specific meaning-contour

Where sphoṭa emphasizes **holistic unity**, vr̥tti emphasizes **directional specification**. Together they form a complete model: meaning **bursts forth** as a unified field (sphoṭa), then **differentiates** through vr̥tti-modulations.

### 3. Three Levels of Vr̥tti

Parallel to Bhartr̥hari's three sphoṭas, this grammar recognizes three vr̥tti-levels:

| Level            | Sphoṭa (Unity)            | Vr̥tti (Modulation)           |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Root-level**   | Semantic field            | Derivational morphology       |
| **Word-level**   | Lexical meaning           | Case marking, aspect          |
| **Clause-level** | Mahā-vr̥tti (finite verb) | Dependency structure, valency |

At each level, a unified potential (sphoṭa) undergoes directional collapse (vr̥tti) to produce structured meaning.

## IV. Lexical Roots as Semantic Fields

### 1. Roots Are Not Meanings

A lexical root is not a fixed meaning but a **semantic potential-space**—a field containing many possible emanations:
- √*gam*: not "to go" but the _field of motion, transition, becoming-elsewhere_
- √*bhū*: not "to be" but *the field of emergence, coming-into-presence, ontological flowering*
- √*dṛś*: not "to see" but *the field of perceptual disclosure, witnessing, cognitive contact*

_The root is **pre-linguistic form**: it exists in superposition, unresolved between noun, verb, adjective—all at once and none determinately._

### 2. The Fourier Analogy

Like a complex waveform containing multiple frequencies in superposition, a root contains **all its semantic harmonics simultaneously**:
- The root is the *fundamental frequency*
- Derivations are *overtones*—particular frequencies emphasized through morphological filtering
- A finite clause is the *reconstructed signal*—a specific waveform carved from infinite possibilities

Just as Fourier analysis decomposes a signal into constituent frequencies, morphology **analyzes** the root into its component vr̥tti-possibilities. Synthesis occurs in the clause, where the selected frequency becomes the manifest pulse.

_The root is not a point but a spectral distribution—all meanings shimmer in latency, and grammar is the apparatus that collapses observation._

### 3. Semantic Superposition and Polysemy

Before derivation, the root exists in **quantum-like indeterminacy**. Traditional linguistics treats polysemy as accidental; this grammar treats it as **intrinsic field structure**:
- √*bandh*: simultaneously "to bind," "bond," "bondage," "connection," "restraint," "relation"
- These are not separate meanings but *interference patterns* within a single field
- Morphology does not choose among options—it **tunes** the field to resonate at a particular mode

_The collapse is not arbitrary: it follows the **valency structure** latent in the field. Certain argument patterns lie dormant in the root and awaken through derivation._

---

## V. Derivation as Reality-Collapse

### 1. Morphology Is Not Additive

Traditional grammar treats morphology as **compositional**: root + affix = meaning₁ + meaning₂.

This grammar treats morphology as **extractive**: each affix is a **filter** that narrows the semantic bandwidth, collapsing superposition into a determinate contour.

_Morphemes do not add; they specify. Each affix selects one harmonic from the root's spectrum._

### 2. The Collapse Sequence

Derivation proceeds as cascading specification:

```
ROOT (infinite potential)
  ↓ [participial filter]
PARTICIPIAL VR̥TTI (event-structure, unanchored)
  ↓ [finiteness filter]
FINITE VR̥TTI (ontological pulse, temporally/aspectually anchored)
  ↓ [case filter]
CLAUSE (fully determinate, all roles/adjuncts assigned)
```

Each step reduces semantic possibility, sharpens relational structure, and preserves the root's essential frequency.

### 3. Compounding as Interference

When roots combine, their semantic fields **interfere** like overlapping waves:
- Constructive interference → coherent, transparent compounds
- Destructive interference → idiomatic, opaque compounds

Example: √*rāja* (field of sovereignty) + √*putra* (field of generation) → *rājaputra*: not "king" + "son" but *the field of royal lineage*—a third entity emergent from harmonic convergence.

_Like Ptolemaic epicycles (circles on circles), complex meanings arise from **iterative modulation**: simple roots + simple morphology → complex meanings through repeated simple operations._

---

## VI. The Verb as Ontological Pulse

### 1. Primacy of Process

**Ontological commitment:** Processes are prior to objects (see [process ontology](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/process-philosophy/)).

Objects do not enter into relations—**relations precipitate objects**. A "thrower" does not exist independently and then throw; the event-field of *throwing* generates the roles "thrower" and "thrown."

The finite verb is therefore:
- The **primary reality** of the clause (mahā-vr̥tti)
- The **generative nucleus** from which all other elements derive meaning
- The **ontological pulse** that radiates identity to its dependents

### 2. Nouns as Crystallized Roles

Nouns are not autonomous entities but **standing waves** in the vr̥tti-field—stable patterns that emerge when the verb's semantic ripples interfere constructively.
- A "river" is not a thing but *the stable locus of flowing*
- A "king" is not an object but *the crystallized role of sovereignty-enacting*
- A "sword" is *the material pole of cutting-vr̥ttis*

_**Every noun is a nominalized vr̥tti**: a process frozen into seeming permanence._

### 3. Case as Geometric Dependency

Case marks **how** a noun-role resonates with the verb-pulse:
- **C1/C2** encode *structural coupling*—the syntactic anchor-points where meaning crystallizes
- **ABL/DAT** encode *directional flow*—emergence and resolution of the pulse
- **SUB** encodes *the ambient medium*—the substrate through which the pulse propagates

_Case is not arbitrary morphology but **geometric necessity**: the mathematical description of how the vr̥tti-field curves semantic space around itself._

---

## VII. Vr̥tti-Centric Clause Architecture

### 1. The Finite Vr̥tti as Mahā-Vr̥tti

Each finite clause has exactly one **mahā-vr̥tti** (great modulation)—the finite verb. This is:
- The **root of dependency**: all other elements attach here
- The **event-pulse**: the primary ontological happening
- The **semantic apex**: the point of maximal specificity

All nouns, cases, and dependent vr̥ttis exist *relative to* this pulse. They have no independent ontological standing within the clause.

### 2. Dependent Vr̥ttis as Upa-Vr̥ttis

Non-finite vr̥ttis (participles) are **subsidiary pulses** or upa-vr̥ttis—secondary modulations that specify properties of nouns, which in turn depend on the mahā-vr̥tti.

Structure: `[upa-vr̥tti] → head-noun → mahā-vr̥tti`

The upa-vr̥tti does not attach directly to the finite verb but modulates the noun, which then participates in the finite vr̥tti-field.

_Like epicycles in Ptolemaic astronomy—subsidiary circles (upa-vr̥ttis) whose centers travel along primary circles (nouns), which themselves orbit the cosmic center (finite verb)._

### 3. No Gaps, No Deletion

**Metaphysical necessity:** If a role exists in the vr̥tti-field, it must manifest.

Fields do not have "gaps"—every frequency present in the semantic spectrum must appear in the syntactic realization. This is not a pragmatic choice but an **ontological requirement**.

Externalization (via inverse cases) relocates the *position* of manifestation but never deletes the role itself. The field remains whole and informationally lossless.

---

## IX. Philosophical Implications

### 1. Language as Cosmogony

This grammar treats every utterance as a **microcosmic creation-event**:
- The root = *unmanifest potential* (prakr̥ti)
- Derivation = *manifestation* (sr̥ṣṭi)
- The finite clause = *integration* (pralaya and renewal)

Speaking is not describing reality but **enacting** the collapse of semantic possibility into determinate form—a linguistic *big bang* contained in every sentence.

### 2. Non-Dualism in Grammar

Just as Advaita Vedānta denies ultimate separation between ātman and brahman, this grammar denies separation between:
- **Root and derivation** (the root already contains all derivations)
- **Verb and noun** (nouns are crystallized verb-fields)
- **Syntax and semantics** (case is geometric necessity, not arbitrary marking)

The illusion of discrete categories (noun, verb, adjective) dissolves into **gradients of vr̥tti-intensity**: semantic fields at different frequencies.

### 3. Syntax as Geometry

The architecture is not conventional but **necessary**: it reflects the actual structure of semantic reality. 

Case, dependency, and clause structure are not human inventions but **discoveries**—the mathematical description of how meaning-waves propagate, interfere, and collapse into linguistic form.
